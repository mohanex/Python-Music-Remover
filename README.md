# Python-Music-Remover
This repo contains a python code that mutes your PC whenever it detects Music, and switchs on back your sound </br>

Many people have decided to stop listening to music, and I'm one of them. Sometimes while watching youtube videos I always press M button to mute video sound whenever there's a song and switch it back when I assume that there's no music.</br>
Thus, I came up with the idea of automating this procedure.


Found python libraries for sound detection and playing :

|---|---|
| Winsound  |   |
| Sounddevice  |   |
| PyAudioWPatch  |   |
